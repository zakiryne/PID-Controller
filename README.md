# Driving a Vehicle with PID Control
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Project Description
In this C++ project, I use a Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller, or PID for short, in order to drive a simulated car around a virtual track. The project involves implementing the controller primarily for the steering angle of the car, as well as tuning coefficients for each PID value in order to calculate a steering angle that keeps the car on the track.

### Steps

    Implement PID Controller for Steering 
    Optimize init parameters for each PID coefficient


## Final Result
The output of the PID around the track is shown here:

### PID explanation
The actual implementation of code for a basic PID controller is fairly straightforward, but making the controller actually perform well is the tough part. Having knowledge of each part of "PID" is important:

The "P" for proportional means that the car will steer in proportion to the cross-track error, or CTE. CTE is essentially how far from the middle line of the road the car is. This makes sense, as if the car is to the left of the line then you would want to steer to the right; if it is far to the left of the middle with a high CTE then you want a higher steering angle. However, if the coefficient is set too high for P, the car will oscillate a ton, as the car will constantly overcorrect and overshoot the middle. If the coefficient is too low, the car may react too slowly to curves when the car gets off-center with a higher CTE.

The "I" for integral sums up all CTEs up to that point, such that too many negative CTEs (in this case, meaning the car has been to the left of the middle of the lane for awhile) will drive up this value, causing the car to turn back toward the middle, preventing the car from driving on one side of the lane the whole time. If the coefficient is too high for I, the car tends to have quicker oscillations, and does not tend to get up to a quick speed. A low coefficent for I will cause the car to tend to drift to one side of the lane or the other for longer periods of time.
   
The "D" for derivate is the change in CTE from one value to the next. This means that 1) if the derivative is quickly changing, the car will correct itself (i.e. higher steering angle) faster, such as in the case of a curve, and 2) if the car is moving outward from the middle, this will cause the steering to get larger (as the derivative sign will match the proportional sign), but if the car is moving toward the center (meaning the derivative value will be negative), the car's steering angle will get smoothed out, leading to a more smoother driving experience. Too high of a coefficient leads to almost constant steering angle changes of large degrees, where although the car will be well-centered it can hardly move. Too low of a D coefficient will lead to the oscillations being too high with more overshooting.


## Final Coefficients
The final values were determined by manual tuning. The ratio of the coefficients to each other that I chose (0.15, 0.0, 0.5) seemed to work well, and I also tried lowering & raising them in conjunction with each other as well as tuning each individually. I typically found that I was creating too high of steering angles (causing crashes if the speed had gotten too high on a straight) by raising them in conjunction with each other, while lowering all of them together meant the car struggled on the larger curves, sometimes not turning enough and shooting off the track.
